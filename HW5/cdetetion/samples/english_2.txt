The Theory of Evolution is a scientific theory that explains how species change over time through a process of natural selection. The theory was first proposed by Charles Darwin in his book On the Origin of Species, published in 1859. It is widely accepted by the scientific community and has revolutionized our understanding of biology and the history of life on Earth.
