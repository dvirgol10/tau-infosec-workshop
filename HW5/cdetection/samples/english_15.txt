The concept of climate change refers to the long-term changes in the Earth's climate, including rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events. The scientific consensus is that climate change is primarily caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.
